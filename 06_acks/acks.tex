\dropcap{O}{ver} the course of my academic journey, there was a comic vignette by Reza Farazmand that played out like a little whisper of reassurance in the form of a mouse, saying, ``\textit{Everything is going according to plan}.'' And what was this plan, you might ask? ``\textit{Hope it all works out}.'' Little did I know, this seemingly light-hearted mantra would resonate with profound truth throughout my Ph.D.\ pursuit.

As I stand here at the conclusion of this challenging yet rewarding chapter of my life, I am profoundly aware that the successful outcome was not solely due to my personal dedication and optimism that everything would work out in the end. It is clear to me that a lot of people played vital roles in this achievement, and I owe them my most sincere gratitude. This journey, with all its accomplishments, simply would not have been possible without their unwavering support and guidance.

I want to start by extending a heartfelt thank you to Guido and Christophe, my supervisory team, for the invaluable opportunity they have given me. Back in 2015, you warmly welcomed me into the MAVLab, making my decision to relocate to The Netherlands and all that it entailed truly worthwhile. Through the trust you placed in me, I was fortunate to live countless unique experiences, from an internship at Georgia Tech to participating in (and winning, \textit{yay!}) the AlphaPilot/AIRR competition. I am aware that I might not have been the easiest student to supervise, owing to my stubbornness and sometimes overly critical attitude, but I felt your confidence in me was always firm, and this allowed me to push even further. Thank you for your support both professionally and personally throughout this journey. It was an honor learning from and working with you.

To co-authors who later became friends, thank you for making my Ph.D.\ journey more fulfilling and enjoyable. Kirk, you were there from the very beginning of my time at the MAVLab, first as a supervisor and then as a colleague. You have been particularly influential during this phase of my life, and I cannot thank you enough for your invaluable contributions to my work and for facilitating my transition into Sony. Yingfu and Nilay, thank you for being my family at work. Your constant support and dedication, positiveness, and willingness to share perspectives from diverse backgrounds have enriched my understanding and broadened my horizons in ways I could have never imagined. Simply put, thank you. Jesse, Stein, and Julien, thank you for the transformative influence you had on the second half of my Ph.D. Your commitment, creativity, engaging discussions, and openness to entertain my, at times, unstructured ideas have been instrumental, and for that, I am truly grateful. I am confident that there are bright futures awaiting each of you, and I eagerly anticipate being a part of them.

I would also like to extend my appreciation to all the members of the MAVLab and C\&S who actively promote and maintain an inclusive and friendly work environment that fosters scientific advancements. Your dedication to creating such an environment has had a positive impact on my academic journey and the experiences of many others. In particular, thanks to Diana, Mario, Tom, Sven, Kimberly, Matěj, and many others who have been a part of this, whether they were here for a while or have moved on. Thank you for sharing the challenges and joys of our personal lives and academic endeavors.

During my time as a Ph.D.\ candidate, I was also fortunate to join Sony Europe for an internship. I would like to extend my gratitude to Oliver Erdler and Guido for making it possible, and to my colleagues Kirk, Diederik, Valentina, Vincent, and Manuel for making this experience both valuable and enjoyable. Having this break halfway through my Ph.D. allowed me to acquire valuable insights and skills that enriched my research journey and enabled me to better shape my professional career. For that, I am truly grateful.

It goes without saying that I hold deep appreciation for my friends outside university. I understand that at times, I can be somewhat distant, both physically and emotionally, but your support and understanding have meant the world to me. Thank you for always being there, whether through in-person interactions or via videogames. It is with you that I can truly find moments of disconnection.

Last but most definitely not least, quiero dar las gracias a mi familia por su apoyo incondicional a lo largo de mi vida, incluso en los momentos en los que mi ambici\'on nos ha distanciado m\'as de lo deseado. Pap\'a y Mam\'a, gracias por vuestra generosidad. Vuestro esfuerzo y sacrificio constante durante todos estos a\~nos ha hecho que, tanto Jes\'us como yo, hayamos crecido con amor, respeto y educaci\'on, además de con acceso a innumerables oportunidades. Sois nuestro ejemplo a seguir y siempre os estaremos agradecidos. Jes\'us, creciste siendo el peque\~no de dos hermanos, siguiendo muchos de mis pasos. Ir\'onicamente, ahora eres t\'u el que act\'ua como referente para m\'i en muchos aspectos. Gracias. Me siento muy afortunado de ser tu hermano, y siempre voy a estar aqu\'i para lo que necesites. Clara, es dif\'icil poner en palabras lo importante que eres para m\'i. Simplemente, gracias por darle equilibrio a mi vida y por cuidarme. Te quiero y admiro profundamente. Espero poder compensar en los pr\'oximos a\~nos todos los sacrificios que has hecho por m\'i y por este doctorado, el cual estoy orgulloso de poder compartir hoy contigo. Por \'ultimo, gracias de todo coraz\'on a mis abuelos/as, t\'ios/as (incluyendo, por descontado, a los presidentes de Komory's Club) y primos/as. Todos hab\'eis contribuido de una forma u otra, pero siempre positivamente, a que hoy pueda estar donde estoy. A todos, os quiero mucho.\newpage

As I close this chapter and step into new beginnings, I carry not only the knowledge and skills I've gained, but also the understanding that having a supportive community can truly transform one's journey. The mouse's simple but strangely profound mantra now reflects the gratitude I hold for each individual who played a part in making sure that, in the end, everything did work out.
