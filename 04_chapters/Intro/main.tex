Titles and alternatives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning event-based robot vision
    \item Learning event-based autonomous flight
    \item Eyes only: autonomous flying robots with just event-based vision
    \item Eyes only: autonomous flying robots using event-based vision alone
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem statement and research questions}

\tcbset{colframe=black!90!, coltitle=white}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Main Research Question}}]
    How can robots learn to perceive the world with event-based vision in a way that enables effective acting in that world?
\end{tcolorbox}

Enables effective acting: to stress that solutions must be portable and low-enough latency for robots to actually be useful.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Problem Statement}}]
    How can a flying robot learn to navigate autonomously when it only has event-based vision?
\end{tcolorbox}

Problem statement: more specific and concrete than main RQ.

% \subsection*{RQ1}

\tcbset{colframe=black!60!, coltitle=white}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research Question 1}}]
    How can a neural network learn to estimate low-latency optical flow from events in a self-supervised manner?
\end{tcolorbox}

% \subsection*{RQ2}

\tcbset{colframe=black!60!, coltitle=white}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research Question 2}}]
    How can a fully neuromorphic vision-to-control pipeline be realized onboard a flying robot?
\end{tcolorbox}

Maybe call ``fully neuromorphic optical flow control''?

% \subsection*{RQ3}

\tcbset{colframe=black!60!, coltitle=white}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research Question 3}}]
    How can a flying robot learn to estimate depth from events in an online, self-supervised manner?
\end{tcolorbox}

Maybe want to add that this happens on-board? Maybe also use ``neural network'' instead of ``flying robot''?

% \subsection*{RQ4}

\tcbset{colframe=black!60!, coltitle=white}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research Question 4}}]
    How can a neural network learn to estimate flight attitude from events, with the goal of replacing inertial sensors?
\end{tcolorbox}
